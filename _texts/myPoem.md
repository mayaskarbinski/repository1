- Your skin like dawn[^fn1]
- Mine like dusk[^fn2]


- One paints the beginning
- of a certain end. 
     

- The other, the end of a 
- sure beginning.[^fn3]

## Footnotes

[^fn1]: A poem about youth vs old age

[^fn2]: dawn and dusk = alliteration

[^fn3]: This inversion of the previous two lines makes the poem elegant.
